Dockerface is a docker image solution for face detection in videos and images. It deploys a trained Faster R-CNN network on Caffe through an easy to use docker image. Bring your videos and images, run dockerface and obtain videos and images with bounding boxes of face detections and an easy to use face detection annotation text file.

The docker image is large for now because OpenCV has to be compiled and stored in the image to be able to use video and it takes up 7+ GB of space.

Instructions:

Install NVIDIA Cuda 8 and cudnn v5
> https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
> https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Install docker
> https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

Install nvidia-docker
> wget -P /tmp https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/releases/download/v1.0.1/nvidia-docker_1.0.1-1_amd64.deb
> sudo dpkg -i /tmp/nvidia-docker*.deb && rm /tmp/nvidia-docker*.deb

Go to your working folder and create a directory called data, your videos and images should go here. Also create a folder called output.

Run the docker container
> sudo nvidia-docker run -it -v $PWD/data:/opt/py-faster-rcnn/edata -v $PWD/output/video:/opt/py-faster-rcnn/output/video natanielruiz/dockerface

Once inside the container use this command to process videos
> python tools/run_face_detection_on_video.py --gpu 0 --video edata/YOUR_VIDEO_FILENAME --output_string STRING_TO_BE_APPENDED_TO_OUTPUTFILE_NAME

Voila, that easy!
